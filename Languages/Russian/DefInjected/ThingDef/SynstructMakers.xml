  <ABF_Thing_Synstruct_SimpletonGenerator.description>Synstruct simpletons are widely derided by everyone who meets them. Every aspect of them is designed to be as minimalistic and simple as possible - and not in a good way. Other sapient synstructs are especially hostile toward sapient simpletons, seeing them as an insult to their kind. Simpletons are usually created only out of desperation or cruelty. Sapient simpletons often embrace the wretchedness of their existence and seek to prove themselves equals to others or go on paths of wrathful vengeance against their creators. Simpleton drones, of course, do not pay any heed to their own wellbeing, being incapable of thought as they are.\n\nSynstruct simpletons may be formatted into the following types:\n - Drones\n - Reprogrammable drones\n - Sapients</ABF_Thing_Synstruct_SimpletonGenerator.description>

  <ABF_Thing_Synstruct_CommonerGenerator.description>Synstruct commoners are, unsurprisingly, the most common model of synstruct in civil society. They are almost identical in capability and nature to humans - a fact sapient commoners pride themselves on. Like humans, commoners can be found taking almost any path through life, and excel at no one particular aspect of it. Like all sapient synstructs, though, heroic figures and pariahs alike have counted themselves among the commoners' kind, and have risen and fallen in public view with time - all to prove that even the most basic form of synstruct can ascend well past their manufacturer's intent.\n\nSynstruct commoners may be formatted into the following types:\n - Drones\n - Reprogrammable drones\n - Sapients</ABF_Thing_Synstruct_CommonerGenerator.description>

  <ABF_Thing_Synstruct_StoicGenerator.label>stoic</ABF_Thing_Synstruct_StoicGenerator.label>
  <ABF_Thing_Synstruct_StoicGenerator.description>Synstruct stoics are designed to be rugged and hardy individuals. With a great deal of internal systems made to stand up to the test of time, they make ideal survivalists, pioneers, and rebels. Stoics are largely a reserved and perceptive lot, more prone to listening than speaking, and are often disdainful of those who break down mentally under stress. Like all sapient synstructs, though, outliers and renegades exist - many of whom are notorious outlaws, anarchists, monastic firebrands, and intergalactic explorers.\n\nSynstruct stoics may be formatted into the following types:\n - Sapients</ABF_Thing_Synstruct_StoicGenerator.description>

  <ABF_Thing_Synstruct_SocialiteGenerator.label>socialite</ABF_Thing_Synstruct_SocialiteGenerator.label>
  <ABF_Thing_Synstruct_SocialiteGenerator.description>Synstruct socialites are designed with communal living in mind and have systems meticulously theorized around evolving social situations. Most socialites embrace their model's design philosophy and are gregarious and extroverted individuals who revel both in tightly knit groups and massive anonymous crowds. Like all sapient synstructs, though, outliers and renegades exist that undermine the otherwise noble reputation.\n\nSynstruct socialites may be formatted into the following types:\n - Sapients</ABF_Thing_Synstruct_SocialiteGenerator.description>
